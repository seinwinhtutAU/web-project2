## Project Description
**CalenDo** is a to-do list app integrated with a calendar.
Users can add, update, delete, and view tasks.
Tasks are organized as Today, Upcoming, Completed, and Overdue.
All tasks can also be managed in a calendar view with Month, Week, and Day modes.



The backend uses **REST API** to perform CRUD operations on the main entities:  
**User**, **Task**, **Category**.
